This installs [Azure Artifacts Credential Provider](https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider)
and optionally configures functions which shadow `dotnet`, `nuget`, `npm`, `yarn`, and `rush` which dynamically sets an authentication token
for pulling artifacts from a feed before running the command.

For `npm`, `yarn`, and `rush` this requires that your `~/.npmrc` file is configured to use the ${ARTIFACTS_ACCESSTOKEN}
environment variable for the `authToken`. A helper script has been added that you can use to write your `~/.npmrc`
file during your setup process, though there are many ways you could accomplish this. To use the script, run it like
this:

```
write-npm.sh pkgs.dev.azure.com/orgname/projectname/_packaging/feed1/npm
write-npm.sh pkgs.dev.azure.com/orgname/projectname/_packaging/feed2/npm username
write-npm.sh pkgs.dev.azure.com/orgname/projectname/_packaging/feed3/npm username email
```

You must pass the feed name to the script, but you can optionally provide a username and email if desired. Defaults
are put in place if they are not provided. An example of the `.npmrc` file created is this:

```
//pkgs.dev.azure.com/orgname/projectname/_packaging/feed1/npm/registry/:username=codespaces
//pkgs.dev.azure.com/orgname/projectname/_packaging/feed1/npm/registry/:_authToken=${ARTIFACTS_ACCESSTOKEN}
//pkgs.dev.azure.com/orgname/projectname/_packaging/feed1/npm/registry/:email=codespaces@github.com
//pkgs.dev.azure.com/orgname/projectname/_packaging/feed1/npm/:username=codespaces
//pkgs.dev.azure.com/orgname/projectname/_packaging/feed1/npm/:_authToken=${ARTIFACTS_ACCESSTOKEN}
//pkgs.dev.azure.com/orgname/projectname/_packaging/feed1/npm/:email=codespaces@github.com
```

## Python Keyring Helper

Add the optional `{ "python" : true }` to install a Python Keyring helper that will handle authentication
to Python feeds using the same mechanism as the other languages. To install a package just run something
like:

```
pip install <package_name> --index-url https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<org_name>/_packaging/<feed_name>/pypi/simple
```

When the feed URL is an Azure Artifacts feed pip will use the keyring helper to provide the credentials needed
to download the package.

## OS Support

This feature is tested to work on Debian/Ubuntu and Mariner CBL 2.0

## Changing where functions are configured

By default, the functions are defined in `/etc/bash.bashrc` and `/etc/zsh/zshrc` if the container user is `root`, otherwise `~/.bashrc` and `~/.zshrc`.
This default configuration ensures that the functions are always available for any interactive shells.

In some cases it can be useful to have the functions written to a non-default location. For example:
- the configuration file of a shell other than `bash` and `zsh`
- a custom file which is not a shell configuration script (so that it can be `source`d in non-interactive shells and scripts)

To do this, set the `targetFiles` option to the path script path where the functions should be written. Note that the default paths WILL NOT be used
if the `targetFiles` option is provided, so you may want to include them in the overridden value, or add `source` the custom script in those configurations:

```bash
# .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
{
    // ...
    "targetFiles": "/custom/path/to/auth-helper.sh"
}

# ~/.bashrc

source /custom/path/to/auth-helper.sh
```
